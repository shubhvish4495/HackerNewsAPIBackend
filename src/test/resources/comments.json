This is not an easy problem, if you aren't prepared for it in advance. If 10,000 users sign up tomorrow... you might be very very hosed, as opposed to very very happy."

I didn't apply to YC, but if I did, I'd be putting my stuff up here as well.  I'm surprized nobody else has posted like you did.  That takes some balls and self-belief.<p>I didn't agree with some of the things you've said before, like IP rules, etc.  but you've earned my respect.  Best of luck to you.  :)<p>-Zak Kinion\n"

    "comment": "The only problem is that you have to install something. See, it's not the same as USB drive. Most corporate laptops are locked and you can't install anything on them. That's gonna be the problem. Also, another point where your USB comparison fails is that USB works in places where you don't have internet access. <p>My suggestion is to drop the \"Throw away your USB drive\" tag line and use something else... it will just muddy your vision.<p>Kudos for launching it!!! Launching/shipping is extremely hard and you pulled it off! Super!"

Then it occured to me - who the hell is this guy, and why should I trust my code to be on his server!?<p>That's a huge issue you should consider. Why would people feel comfortable leaving their valuable stuff on \"Drews\" server?"

    "comment": "This has great potential!<p>Only suggestion I would have is go slower on the demo. I know you lost me very early into it switching between windows.<p>If you are looking for a wider audience than those who already know the context of dropbox, make a video where you lay out the case for use of dropbox using simple examples from user point of view(think a college student) and then in the demo show just the basic features. I got the feeling you tried to show too many features too quickly.<p>In general, I have realized it is much better to launch with something that does a few things REALLY well rather than a lot of things with little focus. When you launch with whole lot of features people assume you are competing with the big companies. When you launch small and do it well, it is easier to attract a user-base and THEN keep feeding it more advance features in form of updates.<p>Good luck! Looks slick from the UI.\n"

    "comment": "I have a few qualms with this app:<p>1. For a Linux user, you can already build such a system yourself quite trivially by getting an FTP account, mounting it locally with curlftpfs, and then using SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem.  From Windows or Mac, this FTP account could be accessed through built-in software.<p>2. It doesn't actually replace a USB drive.  Most people I know e-mail files to themselves or host them somewhere online to be able to perform presentations, but they still carry a USB drive in case there are connectivity problems.  This does not solve the connectivity issue.<p>3. It does not seem very \"viral\" or income-generating.  I know this is premature at this point, but without charging users for the service, is it reasonable to expect to make money off of this?"
